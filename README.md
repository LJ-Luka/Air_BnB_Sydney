**Airbnb Project Part 1: Launching Airbnb Sydney**
<br/>
***Role: The general manager of Sydney area at Airbnb***

This project exhibits familiarity with the foundations of SQL including filtering and sorting data from tables, rows,
schema and other data types, aggregations, complex filtering logic and built-in data/strong predicates,
and implementing the GROUP BY and HAVING clause.

In this role we carried out some analysis to find out more about the properties onboarded by my team and answer certain questions as they arise.
We already had cleaned data for our analysis process. We used the data available to help with the analysis. See data table here [Table](https://github.com/LJ-Luka/LJ-Luka.github.io/blob/main/Airbnb_sydney_data_tables.png)

The analysis was done by querying the table in the above link. See questions that arose (through scenarios) and queries used to answer them here [Document](https://github.com/LJ-Luka/LJ-Luka.github.io/blob/main/Airbnb_Sydney_Project)


**Airbnb Project Part 2: Scaling**

I need to make data-driven decisions about my region, as the general manager for Airbnb Sydney. I have had a few encounters with hosts calling in, and anticipate many more calling in that will require the use of SQL in the future.

See cases and how they were handled here [Document](https://github.com/LJ-Luka/LJ-Luka.github.io/blob/main/Airbnb_Sydney_Project), along with findings and some recommendations.
